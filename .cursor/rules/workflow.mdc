# Workflow Tracker

This file tracks the current workflow state and dynamic rules for the Host and Home Cleaners Website project.

## Current State
- **Mode**: Development
- **Last Action**: Updated booking form time slots
- **Notes**:
  - Modified arrival window time slots in ScheduleStep component
  - Changed morning slot from 8:00AM to 9:00AM
  - Changed afternoon slot from 12:00PM to 1:00PM
  - Kept late afternoon slot at 3:00PM
  - Changes committed with conventional commit message
- Upgraded logger in src/lib/logger.ts to use loglevel-plugin-prefix and kleur for colored logs in both browser and CLI. Removed manual methodFactory override. Awaiting user confirmation of correct color output in both environments.
- Logger now uses %c and CSS for colored logs in browser, with a delimiter-based workaround to satisfy type requirements. Node.js/CLI still uses kleur. Linter error fixed by returning a string from format and splitting in methodFactory patch.
